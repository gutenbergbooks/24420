    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. Of King Belt and Thorstein Vikingson and their Children.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thus beginneth the tale, telling how that King Beli ruled over Sogn-land;
      three children had he, whereof Helgi was his first son, and Halfdan his
      second, but Ingibiorg his daughter. Ingibiorg was fair of face and wise of
      mind, and she was ever accounted the foremost of the king's children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now a certain strand went west of the firth, and a great stead was
      thereon, which was called Baldur's Meads; a Place of Peace was there, and
      a great temple, and round about it a great garth of pales: many gods were
      there, but amidst them all was Baldur held of most account. So jealous
      were the heathen men of this stead, that they would have no hurt done
      therein to man nor beast, nor might any man have dealings with a woman
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sowstrand was the name of that stead whereas the king dwelt; but on the
      other side the firth was an abode named Foreness, where dwelt a man called
      Thorstein, the son of Viking; and his stead was over against the king's
      dwelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorstein had a son by his wife called Frithiof: he was the tallest and
      strongest of men, and more furnished of all prowess than any other man,
      even from his youth up. Frithiof the Bold was he called, and so well
      beloved was he, that all prayed for good things for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the king's children were but young when their mother died; but a
      goodman of Sogn, named Hilding, prayed to have the king's daughter to
      foster: so there was she reared well and needfully: and she was called
      Ingibiorg the Fair. Frithiof also was fostered of goodman Hilding,
      wherefore was he foster-brother to the king's daughter, and they two were
      peerless among children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now King Beli's chattels began to ebb fast away from his hands, for he was
      grown old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorstein had rule over the third part of the realm, and in him lay the
      king's greatest strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every third year Thorstein feasted the king at exceeding great cost, and
      the king feasted Thorstein the two years between.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helgi, Beli's son, from his youth up turned much to blood-offering:
      neither were those brethren well-beloved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorstein had a ship called Ellidi, which pulled fifteen oars on either
      board; it ran up high stem and stern, and was strong-built like an
      ocean-going ship, and its bulwarks were clamped with iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      So strong was Frithiof that he pulled the two bow oars of Ellidi; but
      either oar was thirteen ells long, and two men pulled every oar
      otherwhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frithiof was deemed peerless amid the young men of that time, and the
      king's sons envied him, whereas he was more praised than they.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now King Beli fell sick; and when the sickness lay heavy on him he called
      his sons to him and said to them: &ldquo;This sickness will bring me to mine
      end, therefore will I bid you this, that ye hold fast to those old friends
      that I have had; for meseems in all things ye fall short of that father
      and son, Thorstein and Frithiof, yea, both in good counsel and in
      hardihood. A mound ye shall raise over me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So with that Beli died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter Thorstein fell sick; so he spake to Frithiof: &ldquo;Kinsman,&rdquo; says
      he, &ldquo;I will crave this of thee, that thou bow thy will before the king's
      sons, for their dignity's sake; yet doth my heart speak goodly things to
      me concerning thy fortune. Now would I be laid in my mound over against
      King Beli's mound, down by the sea on this side the firth, whereas it may
      be easiest for us to cry out each to each of tidings drawing nigh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little after this Thorstein departed, and was laid in mound even as he
      had bidden; but Frithiof took the land and chattels after him. Biorn and
      Asmund were Frithiof s foster-brethren; they were big and strong men both.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. Frithiof wooeth Ingibiorg of those Brethren.
    </h2>
    <p>
      So Frithiof became the most famed of men, and the bravest in all things
      that may try a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biorn, his foster-brother, he held in most account of all, but Asmund
      served the twain of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ship Ellidi, he gat, the best of good things, of his father's
      heritage, and another possession therewith&mdash;a gold ring; no dearer
      was in Norway.
    </p>
    <p>
      So bounteous a man was Frithiof withal, that it was the talk of most, that
      he was a man of no less honour than those brethren, but it were for the
      name of king; and for this cause they held Frithiof in hate and enmity,
      and it was a heavy thing to them that he was called greater than they:
      furthermore they thought they could see that Ingibiorg, their sister, and
      Frithiof were of one mind together.
    </p>
    <p>
      It befell hereon that the kings had to go to a feast to Frithiof s house
      at Foreness; and there it happened according to wont that he gave to all
      men beyond that they were worthy of. Now Ingibiorg was there, and she and
      Frithiof talked long together; and the king's daughter said to him:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;A goodly gold ring hast thou.&rdquo;
           &ldquo;Yea, in good sooth,&rdquo; said he.
</pre>
    <p>
      Thereafter went those brethren to their own home, and greater grew their
      enmity of Frithiof.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little after grew Frithiof heavy of mood, and Biorn, his foster-brother,
      asked him why he fared so.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said he had it in his mind to woo Ingibiorg. &ldquo;For though I be named by
      a lesser name than those brethren, yet am I not fashioned lesser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so let us do then,&rdquo; quoth Biorn. So Frithiof fared with certain men
      unto those brethren; and the kings were sitting on their father's mound
      when Frithiof greeted them well, and then set forth his wooing, and prayed
      for their sister Ingibiorg, the daughter of Beli.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kings said: &ldquo;Not overwise is this thine asking, whereas thou wouldst
      have us give her to one who lacketh dignity; wherefore we gainsay thee
      this utterly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Said Frithiof: &ldquo;Then is mine errand soon sped; but in return never will I
      give help to you henceforward, nay, though ye need it ever so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They said they heeded it nought: so Frithiof went home, and was joyous
      once more.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. Of King Ring and those Brethren.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was a king named Ring, who ruled over Ringrealm, which also was in
      Norway: a mighty folk-king he was, and a great man, but come by now unto
      his latter days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he spake to his men: &ldquo;Lo, I have heard that the sons of King Beli have
      brought to nought their friendship with Frithiof, who is the noblest of
      men; wherefore will I send men to these kings, and bid them choose whether
      they will submit them to me and pay me tribute, or else that I bring war
      on them: and all things then shall lie ready to my hand to take, for they
      have neither might nor wisdom to withstand me; yet great fame were it to
      my old age to overcome them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that fared the messengers of King Ring, and found those brethren,
      Helgi and Halfdan, in Sogn, and spake to them thus: &ldquo;King Ring sends
      bidding to you to send him tribute, or else will he war against your
      realm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They answered and said that they would not learn in the days of their
      youth what they would be loth to know in their old age, even how to serve
      King Ring with shame. &ldquo;Nay, now shall we draw together all the folk that
      we may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even so they did; but now, when they beheld their force that it was but
      little, they sent Hilding their fosterer to Frithiof to bid him come help
      them against King Ring. Now Frithiof sat at the knave-play when Hilding
      came thither, who spake thus: &ldquo;Our kings send thee greeting, Frithiof, and
      would have thy help in battle against King Ring, who cometh against their
      realm with violence and wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frithiof answered him nought, but said to Biorn, with whom he was playing:
      &ldquo;A bare place in thy board, foster-brother, and nowise mayst thou amend
      it; nay, for my part I shall beset thy red piece there, and wot whether it
      be safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Hilding spake again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;King Helgi bade me say thus much, Frithiof, that thou shouldst go on this
      journey with them, or else look for ill at their hands when they at the
      last come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A double game, foster-brother,&rdquo; said Biorn; &ldquo;and two ways to meet thy
      play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frithiof said: &ldquo;Thy play is to fall first on the knave, yet the double
      game is sure to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No other outcome of his errand had Hilding: he went back speedily to the
      kings, and told them Frithiof's answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      They asked Hilding what he made out of those words. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereas he spake of the bare place he will have been thinking of the lack
      in this journey of yours; but when he said he would beset the red piece,
      that will mean Ingibiorg, your sister; so give ye all the heed ye may to
      her. But whereas I threatened him with ill from you, Biorn deemed the game
      a double one; but Frithiof said that the knave must be set on first,
      speaking thereby of King Ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So then the brethren arrayed them for departing; but, ere they went, they
      let bring Ingibioig and eight women with her to Baldur's Meads, saying
      that Frithiof would not be so mad rash as to go see her thither, since
      there was none who durst make riot there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then fared those brethren south to Jadar, and met King Ring in Sogn-Sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, herewith was King Ring most of all wroth that the brothers had said
      that they accounted it a shame to fight with a man so old that he might
      not get a-horseback unholpen.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. Frithiof goes to Baldur's Meads.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Straightway whenas the kings were gone away Frithiof took his raiment of
      state and set the goodly gold ring on his arm; then went the
      foster-brethren down to the sea and launched Ellidi. Then said Biorn:
      &ldquo;Whither away, foster-brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Baldur's Meads,&rdquo; said Frithiof, &ldquo;to be glad with Ingibiorg.&rdquo;,
    </p>
    <p>
      Biorn said: &ldquo;A thing unmeet to do, to make the gods wroth with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it shall be risked this time,&rdquo; said Frithiof; &ldquo;and withal, more to
      me is Ingibiorg's grace than Baldur's grame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Therewith they rowed over the firth, and went up to Baldur's Meads and to
      Ingibiorg's bower, and there she sat with eight maidens, and the new
      comers were eight also.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when they came there, lo, all the place was hung with cloth of pall
      and precious webs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Ingibiorg arose and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why art thou so overbold, Frithiof, that thou art come here without the
      leave of my brethren to make the gods angry with thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frithiof says: &ldquo;Howsoever that may be, I hold thy love of more account
      than the gods' hate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ingibiorg answered: &ldquo;Welcome art thou here, thou and thy men!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she made place for him to sit beside her, and drank to him in the
      best of wine; and thus they sat and were merry together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then beheld Ingibiorg the goodly ring on his arm, and asked him if that
      precious thing were his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frithiof said Yea, and she praised the ring much. Then Frithiof said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give thee the ring if thou wilt promise to give it to no one, but
      to send it to me when thou no longer shalt have will to keep it: and
      hereon shall we plight troth each to other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So with this troth-plighting they exchanged rings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frithiof was oft at Baldur's Meads a-night time, and every day between
      whiles would he go thither to be glad with Ingibiorg.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. Those Brethren come Home again.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now tells the tale of those brethren, that they met King Ring, and he had
      more folk than they: then went men betwixt them, and sought to make peace,
      so that no battle should be: thereto King Ring assented on such terms that
      the brethren should submit them to him, and give him in marriage Ingibiorg
      their sister, with the third part of all their possessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kings said Yea thereto, for they saw that they had to do with
      overwhelming might: so the peace was fast bound by oaths, and the wedding
      was to be at Sogn whenas King Ring should go see his betrothed.
    </p>
    <p>
      So those brethren fare home with their folk, right ill content with
      things. But Frithiof, when he deemed that the brethren might be looked for
      home again, spake to the king's daughter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweetly and well have ye done to us, neither has goodman Baldur been
      wroth with us; but now as soon as ye wot of the kings' coming home, spread
      the sheets of your beds abroad on the Hall of the Goddesses, for that is
      the highest of all the garth, and we may see it from our stead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king's daughter said: &ldquo;Thou dost not after the like of any other: but
      certes, we welcome dear friends whenas ye come to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Frithiof went home; and the next morning he went out early, and when he
      came in then he spake and sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Now must I tell
          To our good men
          That over and done
          Are our fair journeys;
          No more a-shipboard
          Shall we be going,
          For there are the sheets
          Spread out a-bleaching.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then they went out, and saw that the Hall of the Goddesses was all
      thatched with white linen. Biorn spake and said: &ldquo;Now are the kings come
      home, and but a little while have we to sit in peace, and good were it,
      meseems, to gather folk together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So did they, and men came flocking thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the brethren soon heard of the ways of Frithiof and Ingibiorg, and of
      the gathering of men. So King Helgi spake:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wondrous thing how Baldur will bear what shame soever Frithiof and she
      will lay on him! Now will I send men to him, and wot what atonement he
      will offer us, or else will I drive him from the land, for our strength
      seemeth to me not enough that we should fight with him as now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Hilding, their fosterer, bare the king's errand to Frithiof and his
      friends, and spake in such wise: &ldquo;This atonement the kings will have of
      thee, Frithiof, that thou go gather the tribute of the Orkneys, which has
      not been paid since Beli died, for they need money, whereas they are
      giving Ingibiorg their sister in marriage, and much of wealth with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frithiof said: &ldquo;This thing only somewhat urges us to peace, the good will
      of our kin departed; but no trustiness will those brethren show herein.
      But this condition I make, that our lands be in good peace while we are
      away.&rdquo; So this was promised and all bound by oaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Frithiof arrays him for departing, and is captain of men brave and of
      good help, eighteen in company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now his men asked him if he would not go to King Helgi and make peace with
      him, and pray himself free from Baldur's wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he answered: &ldquo;Hereby I swear that I will never pray Helgi for peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he went aboard Ellidi, and they sailed out along the Sognnrth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Frithiof was gone from home, King Halfdan spake to Helgi his
      brother: &ldquo;Better lordship and more had we if Frithiof had payment for his
      masterful deed: now therefore let us burn his stead, and bring on him and
      his men such a storm on the sea as shall make an end of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helgi said it was a thing meet to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      So then they burned up clean all the stead at Foreness and robbed it of
      all goods; and after that sent for two witch-wives, Heidi and Hamglom, and
      gave them money to raise against Frithiof and his men so mighty a storm
      that they should all be lost at sea. So they sped the witch-song, and went
      up on the witch-mount with spells and sorcery.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. Frithiof Sails for the Orkneys.
    </h2>
    <p>
      SO when Frithiof and his men were come out of the Sognfirth there fell on
      them great wind and storm, and an exceeding heavy sea: but the ship drave
      on swiftly, for sharp built she was, and the best to breast the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now Frithiof sang:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Oft let I swim from Sogn
          My tarred ship sooty-sided,
          When maids sat o'er the mead-horn
          Amidst of Baldur's Meadows;
          Now while the storm is wailing
          Farewell I bid you maidens,
          Still shall ye love us, sweet ones,
          Though Ellidi the sea fill.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Said Biorn: &ldquo;Thou mightest well find other work to do than singing songs
      over the maids of Baldur's Meadows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of such work shall I not speedily run dry, though,&rdquo; said Frithiof. Then
      they bore up north to the sounds nigh those isles that are called
      Solundir, and therewith was the gale at its hardest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then sang Frithiof:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Now is the sea a-swelling,
          And sweepeth the rack onward;
          Spells of old days cast o'er us
          Make ocean all unquiet;
          No more shall we be striving
          Mid storm with wash of billows,
          But Solundir shall shelter
          Our ship with ice-beat rock-walls.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      So they lay to under the lee of the isles hight Solundir, and were minded
      to abide there; but straightway thereon the wind fell: then they turned
      away from under the lee of the islands, and now their voyage seemed
      hopeful to them, because the wind was fair awhile: but soon it began to
      freshen again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then sang Frithiof:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;In days foredone
          From Foreness strand
          I rowed to meet
          Maid Ingibiorg;
          But now I sail
          Through chilly storm
          And wide away
          My long-worm driveth.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And now when they were come far out into the main, once more the sea waxed
      wondrous troubled, and a storm arose with so great drift of snow, that
      none might see the stem from the stern; and they shipped seas, so that
      they must be ever a-baling. So Frithiof sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;The salt waves see we nought
          As seaward drive we ever
          Before the witch-wrought weather,
          We well-famed kings'-defenders:
          Here are we all a-standing,
          With all Solundir hull-down,
          Eighteen brave lads a-baling
          Black Ellidi to bring home.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Said Biorn: &ldquo;Needs must he who fareth far fall in with diverse hap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yea, certes, foster-brother,&rdquo; said Frithiof. And he sang withal:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Helgi it is that helpeth
          The white-head billows' waxing;
          Cold time unlike the kissing
          In the close of Baldut's Meadow!
          So is the hate of Helgi
          To that heart's love she giveth.
          O would that here I held her,
          Gift high above all giving!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Biorn, &ldquo;she is looking higher than thou now art: what matter
      when all is said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says Frithiof, &ldquo;now is the time to show ourselves to be men of
      avail, though blither tide it was at Baldur's Meadows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they turned to in manly wise, for there were the bravest of men come
      together in the best ship of the Northlands. But Frithiof sang a stave:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;So come in the West-sea,
          Nought see I the billows,
          The sea-water seemeth
          As sweeping of wild-fire.
          Topple the rollers,
          Toss the hills swan-white,
          Ellidi wallows
          O'er steep of the wave-hills.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then they shipped a huge sea, so that all stood a-baling. But Frithiof
      sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;With love-moved mouth the maiden
          Mepledgeth though I founder.
          Ah! bright sheets lay a-bleaching,
          East there on brents the swan loves.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Biorn said: &ldquo;Art thou of mind belike that the maids of Sogn will weep many
      tears over thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Said Frithiof: &ldquo;Surely that was in my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Therewith so great a sea broke over the bows, that the water came in like
      the in-falling of a river; but it availed them much that the ship was so
      good, and the crew aboard her so hardy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now sang Biorn:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;No widow, methinks,
          To thee or me drinks;
          No ring-bearer fair
          Biddeth draw near;
          Salt are our eyne
          Soaked in the brine;
          Strong our arms are no more,
          And our eyelids smart sore.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Quoth Asmund: &ldquo;Small harm though your arms be tried somewhat, for no pity
      we had from you when we rubbed our eyes whenas ye must needs rise early
      a-mornings to go to Baldu's Meadows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Frithiof, &ldquo;why singest thou not, Asmund?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said Asmund; yet sang a ditty straightway:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Sharp work about the sail was
          When o'er the ship seas tumbled,
          And there was I a-working
          Within-board 'gainst eight balers;
          Better it was to bower,
          Bringing the women breakfast,
          Than here to be 'mid billows
          Black Ellidi a-baling.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou accountest thy help of no less worth than it is?&rdquo; said Frithiof,
      laughing therewith; &ldquo;but sure it showeth the thrall's blood in thee that
      thou wouldst fain be awaiting at table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now it blew harder and harder yet, so that to those who were aboard liker
      to huge peaks and mountains than to waves seemed the sea-breakers that
      crashed on all sides against the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Frithiof sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;On bolster I sat.
          In Baldur's Mead erst,
          And all songs that I could
          To the king's daughter sang;
          Now on Ran's bed belike
          Must I soon be a-lying,
          And another shall be
          By Ingibiorg's side.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Biorn said: &ldquo;Great fear lieth ahead of us, foster-brother, and now dread
      hath crept into thy words, which is ill with such a good man as thou.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Says Frithiof: &ldquo;Neither fear nor fainting is it, though I sing now of
      those our merry journeys; yet perchance more hath been said of them than
      need was: but most men would think death surer than life, if they were so
      bested as we be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet shall I answer thee somewhat,&rdquo; said Biorn, and sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Yet one gain have I gotten
          Thou gatst not 'mid thy fortune,
          For meet play did I make me
          With Ingibiorgs eight maidens;
          Red rings we laid together
          Aright in Baldur's Meadow,
          When far off was the warder
          Of the wide land of Halfdan.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we must be content with things as they are,
      foster-brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Therewith so great a sea smote them, that the bulwark was broken and both
      the sheets, and four men were washed overboard and all lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then sang Frithiof:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Both sheets are bursten
          Amid the great billows,
          Four swains are sunk
          In the fathomless sea?
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, meseems,&rdquo; said Frithiof, &ldquo;it may well be that some of us will go to
      the house of Ran, nor shall we deem us well sped if we come not thither in
      glorious array; wherefore it seems good to me that each man of us here
      should have somewhat of gold on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he smote asunder the ring, Ingibiorg's gift, and shared it between
      all his men, and sang a stave withal:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;The red ring here I hew me
          Once owned of Halfdan's father,
          The wealthy lord of erewhile,
          Or the sea waves undo us,
          So on the guests shall gold be,
          If we have need of guesting;
          Meet so for mighty men-folk
          Amid Ran's hall to hold them.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not all so sure is it that we come there,&rdquo; said Biorn; &ldquo;and yet it may
      well be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Frithiof and his folk found that the ship had great way on her, and
      they knew not what lay ahead, for all was mirk on either board, so that
      none might see the stem or stern from amidships; and therewith was there
      great drift of spray amid the furious wind, and frost, and snow, and
      deadly cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Frithiof went up to the masthead, and when he came down he said to his
      fellows: &ldquo;A sight exceeding wondrous have I seen, for a great whale went
      in a ring about the ship, and I misdoubt me that we come nigh to some
      land, and that he is keeping the shore against us; for certes King Helgi
      has dealt with us in no friendly wise, neither will this his messenger be
      friendly. Moreover I saw two women on the back of the whale, and they it
      is who will have brought this great storm on us with the worst of spells
      and witchcraft; but now we shall try which may prevail, my fortune or
      their devilry, so steer ye at your straightest, and I will smite these
      evil things with beams.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          Therewith he sang a stave:
          &ldquo;See I troll women
          Twain on the billows,
          Een they whom Helgi
          Hither hath sent.
          Ellidi now
          Or ever her way stop
          Shall smile the backs
          Of these asunder.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      So tells the tale that this wonder went with the good ship Ellidi, that
      she knew the speech of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Biorn said: &ldquo;Now may we see the treason of those brethren against us.&rdquo;
       Therewith he took the tiller, but Frithiof caught up a forked beam, and
      ran into the prow, and sang a stave:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Ellidi, hail!
          Leap high o'er the billows!
          Break of the troll wives
          Brow or teeth now!
          Break cheek or jaw
          Of the cursed woman,
          One foot or twain
          Of the ogress filthy.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Therewith he drave his fork at one of the skin-changers, and the beak of
      Ellidi smote the other on the back, and the backs of both were broken; but
      the whale took the deep, and gat him gone, and they never saw him after.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the wind fell, but the ship lay waterlogged; so Frithiof called out
      to his men, and bade bale out the ship, but Biorn said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need to work now, verily!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be thou not afeard, foster-brother,&rdquo; said Frithiof, &ldquo;ever was it the wont
      of good men of old time to be helpful while they might, whatsoever should
      come after.&rdquo; And therewith he sang a stave:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;No need, fairfellows,
          To fear the death-day;
          Rather be glad,
          Good men of mine:
          For if dreams wot aught
          All nights they say
          I yet shall have
          My Ingibiorg.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then they baled out the ship; and they were now come nigh unto land; but
      there was yet a flaw of wind in their teeth. So then did Frithiof take the
      two bow oars again, and rowed full mightily. Therewith the weather
      brightened, and they saw that they were come out to Effia Sound, and so
      there they made land.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crew were exceeding weary; but so stout a man was Frithiof that he
      bore eight men a-land over the foreshore, but Biorn bore two, and Asmund
      one. Then sang Frithiof:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Fast bare I up
          To the fire-lit house
          My men all dazed
          With the drift of the storm;
          And the sail moreover
          To the sand I carried;
          With the might of the sea
          Is there no more to do.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. Frithiof at the Orkneys.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now Earl Angantyr was at Effia whenas Frithiof and his folk came a-land
      there. But his way it was, when he was sitting at the drink, that one of
      his men should sit at the watch-window, looking weatherward from the
      drinking hall, and keep watch there. From a great horn drank he ever: and
      still as one was emptied another was filled for him. And he who held the
      watch when Frithiof came a-land was called Hallward; and now he saw where
      Frithiof and his men went, and sang a stave:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Men see I a-baling
          Amid the storm's might;
          Six bale on Ellidi
          Seven are a-rowing;
          Like is he in the stem,
          Straining hard at the oars,
          To Frithiof the bold,
          The brisk in the battle.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      So when he had drunk out the horn, he cast it in through the window, and
      spake to the woman who gave him drink:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Take up from the floor,
          O fair-going woman,
          The horn cast adown
          Drunk out to the end!
          I behold men at sea
          Who, storm-beaten, shall need
          Help at our hands
          Ere the haven they make.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Now the Earl heard what Hallward sang; so he asked for tidings, and
      Hallward said: &ldquo;Men are come a-land here, much forewearied, yet brave lads
      belike: but one of them is so hardy that he beareth the others. ashore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then said the Earl, &ldquo;Go ye, and meet them, and welcome them in seemly
      wise; if this be Frithiof, the son of Hersir Thorstein, my friend, he is a
      man famed far and wide for all prowess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there took up the word a man named Atli, a great viking, and he
      spake: &ldquo;Now shall that be proven which is told of, that Frithiof hath
      sworn never to be first in the craving of peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were ten men in company with him, all evil and outrageous, who often
      wrought berserksgang.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when they met Frithiof they took to their weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Atli said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good to turn hither, Frithiof! Clutching ernes should claw; and we no
      less, Frithiof! Yea, and now may'st thou hold to thy word, and not crave
      first for peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Frithiof turned to meet them, and sang a stave:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Nay, nay, in nought
          Now shall ye cow us.
          Blenching hearts
          Isle-abiders!
          Alone with you ten
          The fight will I try,
          Rather than pray
          For peace at your hands.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then came Hallward thereto, and spake: &ldquo;The Earl wills that ye all be made
      welcome here: neither shall any set on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frithiof said he would take that with a good heart; howsoever he was ready
      for either peace or war.
    </p>
    <p>
      So thereon they went to the Earl, and he made Frithiof and all his men
      right welcome, and they abode with him, in great honour holden, through
      the wintertide; and oft would the Earl ask of their voyage: so Biorn sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;There baled we, wight fellows,
          Washed over and over
          On both boards
          By billows;
          For ten days we baled there,
          And eight thereunto.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The Earl said: &ldquo;Well nigh did the king undo you; it is ill seen of
      such-like kings as are meet for nought but to overcome men by wizardry.
      But now I wot,&rdquo; says Angantyr, &ldquo;of thine errand hither, Frithiof, that
      thou art sent after the scat: whereto I give thee a speedy answer, that
      never shall King Helgi get scat of me, but to thee will I give money, even
      as much as thou wilt; and thou mayest call it scat if thou hast a mind to,
      or whatso else thou wilt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Frithiof said that he would take the money.

      CHAPTER VIII. King Ring weddeth Ingibiorg.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now shall it be told of what came to pass in Norway the while Frithiof was
      away: for those brethren let burn up all the stead at Foreness. Moreover,
      while the weird sisters were at their spells they tumbled down from off
      their high witch-mount, and brake both their backs.
    </p>
    <p>
      That autumn came King Ring north to Sogn to his wedding, and there at a
      noble feast drank his bridal with Ingibiorg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whence came that goodly ring which thou hast on thine arm?&rdquo; said King
      Ring to Ingibiorg.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said her father had owned it, but he answered and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, for Frithiof s gift it is: so take it off thine arm straightway; for
      no gold shalt thou lack whenas thou comest to Elfhome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she gave the ring to King Helgi's wife, and bade her give it to
      Frithiof when he came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then King Ring wended home with his wife, and loved her with exceeding
      great love.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. Frithiof brings the Tribute to the Kings.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The spring after these things Frithiof departed from the Orkneys and Earl
      Angantyr in all good liking; and Hallward went with Frithiof.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when they came to Norway they heard tell of the burning of Frithiof's
      stead.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when he was gotten to Foreness, Frithiof said: &ldquo;Black is my house waxen
      now; no friends have been at work here.&rdquo; And he sang withal:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Frank and free,
          With my father dead,
          In Foreness old
          We drank aforetime.
          Now my abode
          Behold I burned;
          For many ill deeds
          The kings must I pay.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then he sought rede of his men what was to be done; but they bade him look
      to it: then he said that the scat must first be paid out of hand. So they
      rowed over the Firth to Sowstrand; and there they heard that the kings
      were gone to Baldur's Meads to sacrifice to the gods; so Frithiof and
      Biorn went up thither, and bade Hallward and Asmund break up meanwhile all
      ships, both great and small, that were anigh; and they did so. Then went
      Frithiof and his fellow to the door at Baldur's Meads, and Frithiof would
      go in. Biorn bade him fare warily, since he must needs go in alone; but
      Frithiof charged him to abide without, and keep watch; and he sang a
      stave:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;All alone go I
          Unto the stead;
          No folk I need
          For the finding of kings;
          But cast ye the fire
          O'er the kings' dwellingly
          If I come not again
          In the cool of the even.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Biorn, &ldquo;a goodly singing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then went Frithiof in, and saw but few folk in the Hall of the Goddesses;
      there were the kings at their blood-offering, sitting a-drinking; a fire
      was there on the floor, and the wives of the kings sat thereby, a-warming
      the gods, while others anointed them, and wiped them with napkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Frithiof went up to King Helgi and said: &ldquo;Have here thy scat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And therewith he heaved up the purse wherein was the silver, and drave it
      on to the face of the king; whereby were two of his teeth knocked out, and
      he fell down stunned in his high seat; but Halfdan got hold of him, so
      that he fell not into the fire. Then sang Frithiof:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Have here thy scat,
          High lord of the warriors!
          Heed that and thy teeth,
          Lest all tumble about thee!
          Lo the silver abideth
          At the bight of this bag here,
          That Biorn and I
          Betwixt us have borne thee.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Now there were but few folk in the chamber, because the drinking was in
      another place; so Frithiof went out straightway along the floor, and
      beheld therewith that goodly ring of his on the arm of Helgi's wife as she
      warmed Baldur at the fire; so he took hold of the ring, but it was fast to
      her arm, and he dragged her by it over the pavement toward the door, and
      Baldur fell from her into the fire; then Halfdan's wife caught hastily at
      Baldur, whereby the god that she was warming fell likewise into the fire,
      and the fire caught both the gods, for they had been anointed, and ran up
      thence into the roof, so that the house was all ablaze: but Frithiof got
      the ring to him ere he came out. So then Biorn asked him what had come of
      his going in there; but Frithiof held up the ring and sang a stave:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;The heavy purse smote Helgi
          Hard 'midst his scoundrel's visage:
          Lowly bowed Halfdan's brother,
          Fell bundling 'mid the high seat;
          There Baldur fell a-burning.
          But first my bright ring gat I.
          Fast from the roaring fire
          I dragged the bent crone forward.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Men say that Frithiof cast a firebrand up on to the roof, so that the hall
      was all ablaze, and therewith sang a stave:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Down stride we toward the sea-strand,
          And strong deeds set a-going,
          For now the blue flame bickers
          Amidst of Baldur's Meadow.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And therewith they went down to the sea.
    </p>

    </div>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. Frithiof made an Outlaw.
    </h2>
    <p>
      But as soon as King Helgi had come to himself he bade follow after
      Frithiof speedily, and slay them all, him and his fellows: &ldquo;A man of
      forfeit life, who spareth no Place of Peace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they blew the gathering for the kings' men, and when they came out to
      the hall they saw that it was afire; so King Halfdan went thereto with
      some of the folk, but King Helgi followed after Frithiof and his men, who
      were by then gotten a-shipboard and were lying on their oars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now King Helgi and his men find that all the ships are scuttled, and they
      have to turn back to shore, and have lost some men: then waxed King Helgi
      so wroth that he grew mad, and he bent his bow, and laid an arrow on the
      string, and drew at Frithiof so mightily that the bow brake asunder in the
      midst.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Frithiof saw that, then he gat him to the two bow oars of Ellidi,
      and laid so hard on them that they both brake, and with that he sang a
      stave:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Young Ingibiorg
          Kissed I aforetime,
          Kissed Beli's daughter
          In Baldur's Meadow.
          So shall the oars
          Of Ellidi
          Break both together
          As Helgi's bow breaks.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then the land-wind ran down the firth and they hoisted sail and sailed;
      but Frithiof bade them look to it that they might have no long abiding
      there. And so withal they sailed out of the Sognfirth, and Frithiof sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Sail we away from Sogn,
          E'en as we sailed aforetime,
          When flared the fire all over
          The house that was my fathers'.
          Now is the bale a-burning
          Amidst of Baldur's Meadow:
          But wend I as a wild-wolf,
          Well wot I they have sworn it.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we turn to now, foster-brother?&rdquo; said Biorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may not abide here in Norway,&rdquo; said Frithiof: &ldquo;I will learn the ways of
      warriors, and sail a-warring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they searched the isles and out-skerries the summer long, and gathered
      thereby riches and renown; but in autumn-tide they made for the Orkneys,
      and Angantyr gave them good welcome, and they abode there through the
      winter-tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Frithiof was gone from Norway the kings held a Thing, whereat was
      Frithiof made an outlaw throughout their realm: they took his lands to
      them, moreover, and King Halfdan took up his abode at Foreness, and built
      up again all Baldur's Meadow, though it was long ere the fire was slaked
      there. This misliked King Helgi most, that the gods were all burned up,
      and great was the cost or ever Baldur's Meadow was built anew fully equal
      to its first estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      So King Helgi abode still at Sowstrand.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. Frithiof fareth to see King Ring and Ingibiorg.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Frithiof waxed ever in riches and renown whithersoever he went: evil men
      he slew, and grimly strong-thieves, but husbandmen and chapmen he let
      abide in peace; and now was he called anew Frithiof the Bold; he had
      gotten to him by now a great company well arrayed, and was become
      exceeding wealthy of chattels.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Frithiof had been three winters a-warring he sailed west, and
      made the Wick; then he said that he would go a-land: &ldquo;But ye shall fare
      a-warring without me this winter; for I begin to weary of warfare, and
      would fain go to the Uplands, and get speech of King Ring: but hither
      shall ye come to meet me in the summer, and I will be here the first day
      of summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biorn said: &ldquo;This counsel is naught wise, though thou must needs rule;
      rather would I that we fare north to Sogn, and slay both those kings,
      Helgi and Halfdan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all naught,&rdquo; said Frithiof; &ldquo;I must needs go see King Ring and
      Ingibiorg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Says Biorn: &ldquo;Loth am I hereto that thou shouldst risk thyself alone in his
      hands; for this Ring is a wise man and of great kin, though he be somewhat
      old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Frithiof said he would have his own way: &ldquo;And thou, Biorn, shalt be
      captain of our company meanwhile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they did as he bade, and Frithiof fared to the Uplands in the autumn,
      for he desired sore to look upon the love of King Ring and Ingibiorg. But
      or ever he came there he did on him, over his clothes, a great cloak all
      shaggy; two staves he had in his hand, and a mask over his face, and he
      made as if he were exceeding old.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he met certain herdsmen, and, going heavily, he asked them: &ldquo;Whence are
      ye?&rdquo; They answered and said: &ldquo;We are of Streitaland, whereas the king
      dwelleth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quoth the carle: &ldquo;Is King Ring a mighty king, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They answered: &ldquo;Thou lookest to us old enough to have cunning to know what
      manner of man is King Ring in all wise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carle said that he had heeded salt-boiling more than the ways of
      kings; and therewith he goes up to the king's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when the day was well worn he came into the hall, blinking about as a
      dotard, and took an outward place, pulling his hood over him to hide his
      visage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then spake King Ring to Ingibiorg: &ldquo;There is come into the hall a man far
      bigger than other men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queen answered: &ldquo;That is no such great tidings here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the king spake to a serving-man who stood before the board, and said:
      &ldquo;Go thou, and ask yon cowled man who he is, whence he cometh, and of what
      kin he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the lad ran down the hall to the new-comer and said: &ldquo;What art thou
      called, thou man? Where wert thou last night? Of what kin art thou?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Said the cowled man: &ldquo;Quick come thy questions, good fellow! but hast thou
      skill to understand if I shall tell thee hereof?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yea, certes,&rdquo; said the lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the cowl-bearer, &ldquo;Thief is my name, with Wolf was I last
      night, and in Grief-ham was I reared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then ran the lad back to the king, and told him the answer of the
      new-comer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well told, lad,&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;but for that land of Grief-ham, I know
      it well: it may well be that the man is of no light heart, and yet a wise
      man shall he be, and of great worth I account him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Said the queen: &ldquo;A marvellous fashion of thine, that thou must needs talk
      so freely with every carle that cometh hither! Yea, what is the worth of
      him, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wottest thou no clearer than I,&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;but I see that he
      thinketh more than he talketh, and is peering all about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Therewith the king sent a man after him, and so the cowl-bearer went up
      before the king, going somewhat bent, and greeted him in a low voice. Then
      said the king: &ldquo;What art thou called, thou big man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the cowl-bearer answered and sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Peace-thief they called me
          On the prow with the Vikings;
          But War-thief whenas
          I set widows a-weeping;
          Spear-thief when I
          Sent forth the barbed shafts;
          Battle-thief when I
          Burst forth on the king;
          Hel-thief when I
          Tossed up the small babies:
          Isle-thief when I
          In the outer isles harried;
          Slaws-thief when I
          Sat aloft over men:
          Yet since have I drifted
          With salt-boiling carls,
          Needy of help
          'Ere hither I came.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Said the king: &ldquo;Thou hast gotten thy name of Thief from many a matter,
      then; but where wert thou last night, and what is thy home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cowl-bearer said: &ldquo;In Grief-ham I grew up; but heart drave me hither,
      and home have I nowhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king said: &ldquo;Maybe indeed that thou hast been nourished in Grief-ham a
      certain while; yet also maybe that thou wert born in a place of peace. But
      in the wild-wood must thou have lain last night, for no goodman dwelleth
      anigh named Wolf; but whereas thou sayest thou hast no home, so is it,
      that thou belike deemest thy home nought, because of thy heart that drave
      thee hither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then spake Ingibiorg: &ldquo;Go, Thief, get thee to some other harbour, or in to
      the guest-hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;I am old enow to know how to marshal guests; so do
      off thy cowl, new-comer, and sit down on my other hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yea, old, and over old,&rdquo; said the queen, &ldquo;when thou settest staff-carles
      by thy side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, lord, it beseemeth not,&rdquo; said Thief; &ldquo;better it were as the queen
      sayeth. I have been more used to boiling salt than sitting beside lords.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do thou my will,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;for I will rule this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Thief cast his cowl from him, and was clad thereunder in a dark blue
      kirtle; on his arm, moreover, was the goodly gold ring, and a thick silver
      belt was round about him, with a great purse on it, and therein silver
      pennies glittering; a sword was girt to his side, and he had a great fur
      hood on his head, for his eyes were bleared, and his face all wrinkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! now we fare better, say I,&rdquo; quoth the king; &ldquo;but do thou, queen, give
      him a goodly mantle, well shapen for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou shalt rule, my lord,&rdquo; said the queen; &ldquo;but in small account do I
      hold this Thief of thine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So then he gat a good mantle over him, and sat down in the high-seat
      beside the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen waxed red as blood when she saw the goodly ring, yet would she
      give him never a word; but the king was exceeding blithe with him and
      said: &ldquo;A goodly ring hast thou on thine arm there; thou must have boiled
      salt long enough to get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Says he, &ldquo;That is all the heritage of my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; says the king, &ldquo;maybe thou hast more than that; well, few
      salt-boiling carles are thy peers, I deem, unless eld is deep in mine eyes
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Thief was there through the winter amid good entertainment, and well
      accounted of by all men; he was bounteous of his wealth, and joyous with
      all men: the queen held but little converse with him; but the king and he
      were ever blithe together.

      CHAPTER XII. Frithiof saves the King and Queen on the Ice.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The tale tells that on a time King Ring and the queen, and a great
      company, would go to a feast. So the king spake to Thief: &ldquo;Wilt thou fare
      with us, or abide at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said he had liefer go; and the king said: &ldquo;Then am I the more content.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they went on their ways, and had to cross a certain frozen water. Then
      said Thief: &ldquo;I deem this ice untrustworthy; meseemeth ye fare unwarily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quoth the king: &ldquo;It is often shown how heedful in thine heart thou wilt be
      to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So a little after the ice broke in beneath them, and Thief ran thereto,
      and dragged the wain to him, with all that was therein; and the king and
      the queen both sat in the same: so Thief drew it all up on to the ice,
      with the horses that were yoked to the wain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then spake King Ring: &ldquo;Right well drawn, Thief! Frithiof the Bold himself
      would have drawn no stronger had he been here; doughty followers are such
      as thou!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they came to the feast, and there is nought to tell thereof, and the
      king went back again with seemly gifts.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. The King sleeps before Frithiof.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now weareth away the mid-winter, and when spring cometh, the weather
      groweth fair, the wood bloometh, the grass groweth, and ships may glide
      betwixt land and land. So on a day the king says to his folk: &ldquo;I will that
      ye come with us for our disport out into the woods, that we may look upon
      the fairness of the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So did they, and went flock-meal with the king into the woods; but so it
      befell, that the king and Frithiof were gotten alone together afar from
      other men, and the king said he was heavy, and would fain sleep. Then said
      Thief: &ldquo;Get thee home, then, lord, for it better beseemeth men of high
      estate to lie at home than abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;so will I not do.&rdquo; And he laid him down therewith,
      and slept fast, snoring loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thief sat close by him, and presently drew his sword from his sheath and
      cast it far away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little while after the king woke up, and said: &ldquo;Was it not so, Frithiof,
      that a many things came into thy mind e'en now? But well hast thou dealt
      with them, and great honour shalt thou have of me. Lo, now, I knew thee
      straightway that first evening thou earnest into our hall: now nowise
      speedily shalt thou depart from us; and somewhat great abideth thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Said Frithiof: &ldquo;Lord king, thou hast done to me well, and in friendly
      wise; but yet must I get me gone soon, because my company cometh speedily
      to meet me, as I have given them charge to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So then they rode home from the wood, and the king's folk came flocking to
      him, and home they fared to the hall and drank joyously; and it was made
      known to all folk that Frithiof the Bold had been abiding there through
      the winter-tide.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. King Ring's Gift to Frithiof.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Early of a morning-tide one smote on the door of that hall, wherein slept
      the king and queen, and many others: then the king asked who it was that
      called at the hall door; and so he who was without said: &ldquo;Here am I,
      Frithiof; and I am arrayed for my departure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then was the door opened, and Frithiof came in, and sang a stave:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Have great thanks for the guesting
          Thou gavest with all bounty;
          Dight fully for wayfaring
          Is the feeder of the eagle;
          But, Ingidiorg, I mind thee
          While yet on earth we tarry;
          Live gloriously! I give thee
          This gift for many kisses.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And therewith he cast the goodly ring towards Ingibiorg, and bade her take
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king smiled at this stave of his, and said: &ldquo;Yea, forsooth, she hath
      more thanks for thy winter quarters than I; yet hath she not been more
      friendly to thee than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then sent the king his serving-folk to fetch victuals and drink, and saith
      that they must eat and drink before Frithiof departed. &ldquo;So arise, queen,
      and be joyful!&rdquo; But she said she was loth to fall a-feasting so early.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, we will eat all together,&rdquo; said King Ring; and they did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when they had drank a while King Ring spake: &ldquo;I would that thou abide
      here, Frithiof; for my sons are but children and I am old, and unmeet for
      the warding of my realm, if any should bring war against it.&rdquo; Frithiof
      said: &ldquo;Speedily must I be gone, lord.&rdquo; And he sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Oh, live, King Ring,
          Both long and hale!
          The highest king
          Neath heaven's skirt!
          Ward well, O king,
          Thy wife and land,
          For Ingibiorg now
          Never more shall I meet.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then quoth King Ring:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Fare not away,
          O Frithiof, thus,
          With downcast heart,
          O dearest of chieftains!
          For now will I give thee
          For all thy good gifts,
          Far better things
          Than thou wottest thyself.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And again he sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;To Frithiof the famous
          My fair wife I give,
          And all things therewith
          That are unto me.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then Frithiof took up the word and sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Nay, how from thine hands
          These gifts may I have,
          But if thou hast fared
          By the last way of fate.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The king said: &ldquo;I would not give thee this, but that I deem it will soon
      be so, for I sicken now. But of all men I would that thou shouldst have
      the joy of this; for thou art the crown of all Norway. The name of king
      will I give thee also; and all this, because Ingibiorg's brethren would
      begrudge thee any honour; and would be slower in getting thee a wife than
      I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Said Frithiof: &ldquo;Have all thanks, lord, for thy goodwill beyond that I
      looked for! but I will have no higher dignity than to be called earl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then King Ring gave Frithiof rule over all his realm in due wise, and the
      name of earl therewith; and Frithiof was to rule it until such time as the
      sons of King Ring were of age to rule their own realm. So King Ring lay
      sick a little while, and then died; and great mourning was made for him;
      then was there a mound cast over him, and much wealth laid therein,
      according to his bidding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter Frithiof made a noble feast, whereunto his folk came; and
      thereat was drunken at one and the same time the heritage feast after King
      Ring, and the bridal of Frithiof and Ingibiorg.
    </p>
    <p>
      After these things Frithiof abode in his realm, and was deemed therein a
      most noble man; he and Ingibiorg had many children.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. Frithiof King in Sogn.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now those kings of Sogn, the brethren of Ingibiorg, heard these tidings,
      how that Frithiof had gotten a king's rule in Ringrealm, and had wedded
      Ingibiorg their sister. Then says Helgi to Halfdan, his brother, that
      unheard of it was, and a deed over-bold, that a mere hersir's son should
      have her to wife: and so thereat they gather together a mighty army, and
      go their ways therewith to Ringrealm, with the mind to slay Frithiof, and
      lay all his realm under them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Frithiof was ware of this, he gathered folk, and spake to the
      queen moreover: &ldquo;New war is come upon our realm; and now, in whatso wise
      the dealings go, fain am I that thy ways to me grow no colder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said: &ldquo;In such wise have matters gone that I must needs let thee be
      the highest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now was Biorn come from the east to help Frithiof; so they fared to the
      fight, and it befell, as ever erst, that Frithiof was the foremost in the
      peril: King Helgi and he came to handy-blows, and there he slew King
      Helgi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then bade Frithiof raise up the Shield of Peace, and the battle was
      stayed; and therewith he cried to King Halfdan: &ldquo;Two choices are in thine
      hands now, either that thou give up all to my will, or else gettest thou
      thy bane like thy brother; for now may men see that mine is the better
      part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Halfdan chose to lay himself and his realm under Frithiof's sway; and
      so now Frithiof became ruler over Sogn-folk, and Halfdan was to be Hersir
      in Sogn and pay Frithiof tribute, while Frithiof ruled Ringrealm. So
      Frithiof had the name of King of Sogn-folk from the time that he gave up
      Ringrealm to the sons of King Ring, and thereafter he won Hordaland also.
      He and Ingibiorg had two sons, called Gunnthiof and Hunthiof, men of
      might, both of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      AND SO HERE ENDETH THE STORY OF FRITHIOF THE BOLD. <br /><br />
